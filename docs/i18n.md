# i18n/Multilingual Support
The Emukit Playground has support for additional languages to be added. The playground uses the browser's highest supported preference of language (obtained by [navigator.languages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorLanguage/languages), or [navigator.language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorLanguage/language) for older browsers), or defaults to English if no supported languages are found.

We are open to language contributions. Please refer to our [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## Adding a new language
To add a new language, first duplicate `config/i18n/en.json` to a file in the same directory using the naming scheme `[LANGUAGE CODE].json`, where [LANGUAGE CODE] refers to a [BCP 47](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) representation of the language. Valid language codes include "en", "en-US", "fr", "fr-FR", "es-ES", etc.

Once you have duplicated the file, open `js/playground.js` and add the language code to `languages` array (around line 30).

Now you can start to translate strings into the new langauge. Do not edit the keys of each entry, only edit the value.

Once a translation is complete, feel free to submit a PR. Please see the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
